# Problem Description
Cities often have many modes of transportation available to
residents: Driving, biking, buses and trains, taxi-service apps
like Uber, and walking. Roads and routes can often resemble
mazes, and there is a lot of data to consider that makes it
hard for a human to determine the optimal route to make
it to their destination. However, with modes of transporta-
tion such as driving or biking, you are not constrained by
departure time. This is not the case for most forms of public
transportation, which have a timetable and predefined routes
that you can travel on. The goal of this project is to compare
the speed of algorithms that can handle timetabled forms of
transportation.
